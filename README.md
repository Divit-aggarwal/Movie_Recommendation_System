Movie Recommender System

Content-Based Recommendation Engine

A complete end-to-end Content Based Movie Recommender System built from scratch — covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity modeling, web app integration, and deployment.

This project recommends movies based on content similarity (genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview) rather than user ratings.
